# 2.1. Introducing React components
Components are the fundamental unit of a client-side application written in React. You’ll definitely be creating lots of components!

## 2.1.1. Understanding the application data

Sample JSON API:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "content": "What we hope ever to do with ease, we must first learn to do
     with diligence. — Samuel Johnson",
  "user": {
     "name": "Mark Thomas",
     "id": 1
  },
  "comments": [{
    "id": 0,
    "user": "David",
    "content": "too. mainstream."
  }, {
    "id": 1,
    "user": "Peter",
    "content": "Who was Samuel Johnson?"
  }, {
    "id": 2,
    "user": "Mitchell",
    "content": "@Peter get off Letters and do your homework!"
  }, {
    "id": 3,
    "user": "Peter",
    "content": "@mitchell ok dad :P"
  }]
}
```

## 2.1.2. Multiple components: Composition and parent-child relationships
 Components can have different types of relationships (parent and child), can be used to create other components, or can even stand alone. They can often be easily moved around because they’re self-contained and don’t carry any baggage when moved. As such, they’re said to be composable.

## 2.1.3. Establishing component relationships

# 2.2. Creating components in React

You’ll run code in the browser via [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io).

You’ll use three libraries for your first components: `React`, `React DOM`, and `prop-types`.


Starting out follow as:
```js
//... index.js
const node = document.getElementById("root");

//... index.html
<div id="root"></div>
```

Code is available online at https://codesandbox.io/s/vj9xkqzkvy.

## 2.2.1. Creating React elements
```js
ReactDOM.render(
  ReactElement element,
  DOMElement container,
  [function callback]
) -> ReactComponent
```
React DOM needs an element of type `ReactElement` and a DOM element.

The virtual and “real” DOM share a similar tree-like structure, which makes it easy for you to think about the structure of your components and overall application in React in similar ways. The DOM is comprised of `DOMElements` (`HTMLElements` and `SVGElements`), whereas React’s virtual DOM is comprised of React elements.

React elements are what React uses to create a virtual DOM that `React DOM` will manage and use to reconcile and update the actual DOM. They are simple blueprints for React to use in creating and managing elements.

You now know a little more about React elements in general, but how do they get created and what goes into creating them? You create React elements with `React.createElement`—go figure! Let’s look at its function signature to find out how you should use it:

```js
React.createElement(
  String/ReactClass type,
  [object props],
  [children...]
) -> React Element
```

`React.createElement` takes a string or component (either a class extending React.Component or a function), a props object, and children and returns a React element. Remember, a React element is a lightweight representation of something you want React to render. It can indicate either a DOM element or another React component.


Let’s look more closely at each of these basic instructions:
- *type*
- *props*
- *children...*

`React.createElement` asks, “What am I creating?”, “How should I configure it?”, and “What does it contain?” The following listing shows how you might use `React.createElement`.
```js
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
const node = document.getElementById("root");

const root = React.createElement(
  "div",
  {},
  React.createElement(
    "h1",
    {},
    "Hello, world!",
    React.createElement(
      "a",
      { href: "mailto:mark@ifelse.io" },
      React.createElement("h1", {}, "React In Action"),
      React.createElement("em", {}, "...and now it really is!")
    )
  )
);
render(root, node);
```

## 2.2.2. Rendering your first component
Your first component. It’s not much, but you’ve successfully created a component using React.

</div>



React will recursively evaluate a series of React elements to determine how it should form a virtual DOM tree structure for your components. It will also check for more React elements in `children...` to evaluate. React will go through every possible path, like a child asking, “What is X?” until they know everything. You can follow the arrows down and across to the right to get a sense of how React might evaluate nested React elements as well as what each parameter is asking.

We’ll explore better ways to write components —— JSX.

## 2.2.3. Creating React components
Components serve to bundle up and group functionality, markup, styles, and other related bits of your UI together. They act as a sort of boundary around parts of your UI that can also contain other components. Components can then be independent, reusable pieces that allow you think about each piece in isolation.

## 2.2.4. Creating React classes
To start really building something, you need more than just React elements; you need components. Components in React are classes that help group together React elements and functionality. They can be created as classes that extend the `React.Component` base class or functions. This section explores React classes and how to use this type of component in React. Let’s look at how you create a React class:
```js
class MyReactClassComponent extends Component {
     render() {}
}
```

## 2.2.5. The render method
React will create a backing instance in memory for components created as React component classes. As you can see, React component classes get one, and React elements and non-React class components don’t. Remember that React elements are mirrors of the DOM and components are ways to group them together. The backing instance is a way of providing data storage and access for a specific component. The data stored in the instance will be made available to the component’s render method through specific API methods. This means that you get access to data that you can change and that will persist over time.
